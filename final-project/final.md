# Rise & Shine
## Design Problem Statement
For many people, life can get very hectic. With work, school, and other responsibilities, it can be hard to keep up with healthy personal habits. Not only this, but many busy people find that they don't get a proper amount or quality of sleep, leaving them too tired to handle a lot of their workload. This app is designed around the idea that a good morning routine is the foundation to a good day, and a good morning starts when you wake up feeling fully rested. Understanding that with so much to do during the day it can be hard for many people to go to bed in time to get the proper 8 hours, this app is designed to help people work with the amount of sleep they're more likely to get by waking them up at the end of a sleep cycle. Research has shown that waking up at the completion of a sleep cycle rather than in the middle of one can leave a person feeling well rested and ready to start their day. In addition to this proper wake up, Rise & Shine wants to help people remember to prioritize other healthy habits that can slip through the cracks in their busy schedules. By allowing the user to set daily habit reminders and encouraging them to check off their goals, Rise & Shine aims to help users be mindful in living a healthier lifestyle, without having to do the work to remember more than they have to.

## User Persona
![User Persona](https://kcarino17.github.io/DH150-UX/final-project/User%20Persona%20DH%20150.png)

## Scenario 1

#### Scenario:    
Jennifer is working really hard and finds that she needs her morning cup of joe every day just to keep going. The caffeine helps her to wake up but she hates the crash in the afternoon and she feels jittery all day. She wants to be able to subsist without caffeine but her long, unpredictable hours make it hard for her to go to sleep on time.    
#### Action:      
Using rise and shine, she enters what time she needs to be up in order to get her day started and get to work on time. Then, rise and shine calculates what times Jennifer should be falling asleep so that she can wake up at the very end of a sleep cycle, making a restful wakeup more attainable. 10 minutes before each possible sleep time, Jennifer gets a notification that tells her she may want to head to bed. If she accepts, then the app will not bother her until the morning. If she declines, the app will wait until the next possible sleep time and send another notification. In the morning, she is awakened by rise and shine’s alarm and feels rested and ready to start her day, regardless of how many hours she was able to get.

## Scenario 2

#### Scenario:    
In the hype of her busy schedule, Jennifer hasn’t been able to exercise in a long time. She did yoga for fun in college and got really into it. She wishes she could find time in her day for a quick session but with everything that’s on her plate right now, she always forgets to prioritize it.     

#### Action:      
Jennifer adds her top 3 weekly goals into rise and shine. Rise and shine will add her goal of the day to her morning alarm so she can remember to prioritize her goal that day. She can set a number of times she hopes to accomplish the goal each week. Every week that she meets that number, she gets to check it off on her calendar. If she gets a month of meeting her weekly goal amount, she gets to change one of her goals. This way, she can get regular reminders of personal goals that may slip her mind, and she can track her progress, encouraging her to keep it up and allowing her forgiveness if she can’t meet her habit goal that week.

These wireframes show the thought process behind my design, there were a few changes that I made in the final product, particularly the positioning of the back buttons, which I changed to keep a more consistent and clean style in my app.

## Screen Designs

The three main things that I wanted to design in this app were the main page, the home page, and the calendar page. The main page establishes the theme of the app and gives a good starting point for users to understand the branding. The home page is where the user will spend most of their time, and I wanted to make sure that it was intuitive enough that it would serve as a proper homebase for users. Finally, I wanted the calendar to be visually appealing, useful, and intuitive without the need for any written explanation of how to use it. Some features that were important for me to include based on my user research were the calendar in order to help users keep regular track of their habits, the reasoning behind the wake up time, and the ability to actively check habits off when they were accomplished. According to my research, the satisfaction of checking off an accomplishment helped users to feel motivated. Additionally, getting reminders about their goals and being able to understand the reasons behind why they were doing something were important to my users in terms of goal setting.

## High Fidelity Prototype
[This](https://xd.adobe.com/view/637c76e1-67de-482e-53ce-179da3d37fe5-154d/?fullscreen&hints=off) is my high fidelity prototype. You can interact with it to try out the scenarios that a user would experience in order to use the app. I wanted the user to be able to change the time that they would set their alarm, change their goals or habits, and view their calendar. 

## Usability Test

I had a user test my app to see how intuitive my features actually were. She found the app to be easily navigable and clean. However, she felt that the lack of completion feedback made it confusing to know when a task was completed. I think in working on the design more in the future, I will try to create a more satisfying completion signal for accomplishing tasks in this app. Altogether, my user found the app to be very straightforward and organized. She felt that completing the given tasks did not take too long and they were not difficult to figure out.
