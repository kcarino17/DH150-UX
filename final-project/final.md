# Rise & Shine
## Design Problem Statement
For many people, life can get very hectic. With work, school, and other responsibilities, it can be hard to keep up with healthy personal habits. Not only this, but many busy people find that they don't get a proper amount or quality of sleep, leaving them too tired to handle a lot of their workload. This app is designed around the idea that a good morning routine is the foundation to a good day, and a good morning starts when you wake up feeling fully rested. Understanding that with so much to do during the day it can be hard for many people to go to bed in time to get the proper 8 hours, this app is designed to help people work with the amount of sleep they're more likely to get by waking them up at the end of a sleep cycle. Research has shown that waking up at the completion of a sleep cycle rather than in the middle of one can leave a person feeling well rested and ready to start their day. In addition to this proper wake up, Rise & Shine wants to help people remember to prioritize other healthy habits that can slip through the cracks in their busy schedules. By allowing the user to set daily habit reminders and encouraging them to check off their goals, Rise & Shine aims to help users be mindful in living a healthier lifestyle, without having to do the work to remember more than they have to.
