### 10 Heuristics Analysis

**1. Visibility of system status**
   - There is no system status feedback given. On one hand, pages load quickly enought hat there is no need for a loading graphic. On the other hand, there is no way to tell if the page is loading or if the system is slowing. **(1)**
   - Text highlights when you hover your cursor over it, allowing users to know that the system is working properly and that the text is clickable. This is a good way to show interactable content!

**2. Match between system and the real world**
   - "Menu" on the website is divided into two subsections: "top categories" are listed in one part of the menu and and the other provides links to the glossary of other categories in alphabetical order. This may be helpful to some but I think more guidance and sorting of categories by the web designer would be a more helpful method of organization. That way, the user doesn’t have to check if their topic of interest is in the “popular” category already. **(2)**
   - On the home page, articles are divided into categories of topic or specific formats but none of these categories are present on the menu bar at the top. Examples of these are “Through my eyes”, “animal science”, etc. **(1)**
   - When you go to the page of a certain topic, the first link at the top is the in-depth article defining the problem. This could be helpful for those doing research to get as much information as possible.

**3. User control and freedom**
   - Users can skip to certain subsections of each article by clicking that subsection’s title at the top of the article. However, once chosen, the article scrolls all the way down to that subsection and does not provide the user with a method of going back to the top to browse the other subsections. **(2)**
   - Many links in the articles send users to a different website. There is no warning of this change before it is done. However, the link opens a new tab so if a user wanted to return to the article, they could just exit out of the tab and go back to the page they were originally on. **(1)**

**4. Consistency and standards**

**5. Error Prevention**

**6. Recognition rather than recall**

**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use**

**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design**

**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**

**10. Help and documentation**
